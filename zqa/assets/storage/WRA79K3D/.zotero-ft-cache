ABSTRACT
Employee attrition is a major cost to an organization. Some costs are tangible such as training expenses and the
time it takes from when an employee starts to when they become a productive member. However, the most
important costs are intangible, such as new product ideas, great project management, or customer relationships.
Employee attrition control is critical to the long-term health and success of any organization. An organization
is only as good as its employees, and these people are the true source of its competitive advantage. Accurate
predictions enable organizations to take action for the retention of employees. This project aims to use different
supervised classifiers to make predictions, and chooses the most accurate one.

I. INTRODUCTION
Human resource is the most important asset for a
company to be competitive. Thanks to liberalization
on the labor market, it has become possible for an
employee to leave his job. However, having excess
employees leave their jobs will influence the morale
of the companies. The loss of good employees can
diminish a company’s competitive advantage and
lead to a reduction in output and quality. High
employee attrition has a significant negative effect on
an organization by virtue of lost productivity,
increased training and recruitment costs.
Employees voluntarily leave an organization for
various reasons, such as new opportunities, limited or
no professional growth in current position,
unhappiness with compensation, personal reasons,
etc. By taking proactive action to retain its top
employees, a company can thus reap substantial
benefits, thereby increasing its top and bottom line.
II. LITERATURE REVIEW
Rohit Punnoose et al [1] explored the application of
Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) technique
which is more robust because of its regularization
formulation. Data from the HRIS of a global retailer
was used to compare XGBoost against six historically
used supervised classifiers and its significantly higher
accuracy for predicting employee turnover was
demonstrated.
Vidya Sunil et al [2] conducted a study to find the
main causes behind the increase in employee
attrition in software industries and to find out the
ways to control attrition. The survey revealed that
the attrition rate increased because of dissatisfaction
with pay, relationship with boss, lack of career
advancement and compensation.
Sunil Kumar Dhal [3] et al conducted a study to find
out the main causes which increase the employee
turnover in BPO companies and to find out the way

to control attrition. This study was conducted in
BPO companies at Bhubaneswar.
Moninder Singh et al [4] describe a framework for
using analytics to proactively tackle voluntary
attrition of employees. This approach uses data
mining for identifying employees at risk of attrition
and balances the cost of attrition/replacement of an
employee against the cost of retaining that employee
(by way of increased salary) to enable the optimal use
of limited funds that may be available for this
purpose, thereby allowing the action to be targeted
towards employees with the highest potential returns
on investment.
Santoshi Sengupta [5] presented an approach to
determine what and how job-related and
demographic variables are associated with employee
satisfaction of the BPO employees.
Ankita Srivastava et al [6] proposed a model to
identify the root causes of attrition and retention in
BPOs, analyzing the level of employee motivation,
satisfaction and involvement, generate a model for
maximizing sustenance of employees in the
organization and come up with concrete
recommendations.
Vijay Anand et al [7] carried out a research in BPO
companies in which the opinions of 120 respondents
(both ex-employee and current employee) were
taken. A structured questionnaire was used for
collecting data, and Percentage analysis, Weighted
average method, Chi-square Test and ANOVA have
been incorporated for analysis purpose.
Hsin-Yun Chang [8] proposed a method that could
select subsets more efficiently. In addition, the
reasons why employers voluntarily turnover were
also investigated in order to increase the
classification accuracy and to help managers to
prevent employers’ turnover. The mixed feature
subset selection used in this study combined Taguchi
method and Nearest Neighbor Classification Rules to
select feature subset and analyze the factors to find
the best predictor of employer turnover.
Neeraj Pandey et al [9] presented an approach to
explore the factors behind the high attrition in
Indian ITeS call centres. A focussed group discussion
(FGD) was conducted with a group to discuss the
variables for attrition. Semi-structured interviews
were conducted to validate the responses received
during FGD. The key questions asked during the
interview explored the reasons for joining and also
reasons behind leaving the ITeS call centre jobs.
Rahul Yedida et al [10] discussed the application of
the k-Nearest Neighbours (KNN) algorithm as a
method of predicting employee attrition, with
evaluation of employee performance, average
monthly hours at work and number of years spent in
the company, etc as features. Other approaches
include the use of ANNs, decision trees and logistic
regression.
Rupesh Khare et al [11] presented the application of
logistic regression technique to predict employee
attrition risk in an organization based on
demographic data of separated employees. The
demographic information of both separated and
existing employees was used to develop a risk
equation, which was later applied to assess attrition
risk with current set of employees. Post this
assessment, high risk cluster was identified and focus
group discussions were initiated to find out the
reasons and their requirements and hence action
plan was created to minimize the risk.
III. METHODS
This paper discusses different classification
algorithms of supervised learning and feature
selection algorithms. This section outlines the theory
behind each of these machine learning algorithms.

3.1. Logistic Regression
Logistic regression is a statistical method for
analyzing a dataset in which there are one or more
independent variables that determine an outcome.
The outcome is measured with a dichotomous
variable (in which there are only two possible
outcomes). The goal of logistic regression is to find
the best fitting model to describe the relationship
between the dichotomous characteristic of interest
and a set of independent variables. Logistic
regression generates the coefficients of a formula to
predict a logit transformation of the probability of
presence of the characteristic of interest. The logit
transformation is defined as the logged odds:
=
where p is the probability of presence of the
characteristic of interest.
And logit(p) = ( )
3.2. k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN)
K-nearest neighbors algorithm is a non
parametric method used for classification, where the
input consists of the k closest training examples in
the feature space and the output is a class
membership. An object is classified by a majority
vote of its neighbors, with the object being assigned
to the class most common among its k nearest
neighbors measured by a distance function. The
distance function used is Hamming distance, given
by:
DH = ∑ 
3.3. Random Forest
Random forest is an ensemble learning method that
uses a divide-and-conquer approach used to improve
performance. The main principle behind ensemble
methods is that a group of “weak learners” can come
together to form a “strong learner”.
3.4. SelectKBest
SelectKBest is a feature selection algorithm that
scores the features of a dataset using a score function
and then removes all but the k-highest scoring
features. It takes as a parameter the score function,
which must be applicable to a pair of data from the
training set (X) and test set (y). The score function
returns an array of scores. SelectKBest then simply
retains the first k features of training set with the
highest scores. The score function used is Chi-Square
(chi2). SelectKBest will compute the chi2 statistic
between each feature of X and y (assumed to be class
labels). A small value will mean the feature is
independent of y. A large value will mean the feature
is non-randomly related to y, and so likely to provide
important information. The formula for the chi2
statistic is given by:
χ2 = = ∑ 
where Oi is the observed value and Ei is the expected
value.
3.5. Recursive Feature Elimination
Given an external estimator that assigns weights to
features (e.g., the coefficients of a linear model),
Recursive Feature Elimination selects features by
recursively considering smaller and smaller sets of
features. First, the estimator is trained on the initial
set of features and the importance of each feature is
obtained either through a coef_ attribute or through
a feature_importances_ attribute of the estimator.
Then, the least important features are pruned from
current set of features. This procedure is recursively
repeated on the pruned set until the desired number
of features to select is eventually reached. The
stability of this algorithm depends heavily on the
estimator that is used for feature ranking in each
iteration. The estimator used here is the linear model
of Logistic Regression.

3.6. XGBoost
XGBoost stands for eXtreme Gradient Boosting.
Gradient boosting is an efficient algorithm for
converting relatively poor hypotheses into very good
hypotheses. It is called gradient boosting because it
uses a gradient descent algorithm to minimize the
loss when adding new models. XGBoost is an
implementation of gradient boosting machines,
engineered for efficiency of compute time and
memory resources.
IV. PROPOSED SYSTEM
A fictional dataset created by IBM data scientists is
used for analysis. It has 35 attributes and 1470
observations. There are two class labels for the
feature “Attrition” - Yes and No. The dataset includes
various important features such as Age, Overtime,
DailyRate, Job Satisfaction, Monthly Income,
Distance From Home, Work Life Balance,
EnvironmentSatisfaction, DailyRate etc. There are
34 independent features and 1 dependent feature
(Attrition).
4.1. Data Preprocessing
The missing data from the dataset is handled by
Interpolation, which is a mathematical technique to
estimate the missing values in some interval, when a
number of observed values are available within that
interval. By default, linear interpolation is performed
at the missing data points.
All the categorical values in each column are
converted to numerical values using LabelEncoder. It
encodes the labels with values between 0 and
(number of classes - 1). For example, the feature
MaritalStatus with labels “Divorced”, “Married” and
“Single” is encoded as 0, 1 and 2 respectively.
4.2. Classification
The dataset is split into training and test data in the
ratio 80:20. Different classification algorithms [as
mentioned in Section 3] are used to train the training
set. Furthermore, feature selection algorithms are
also combined with classification algorithms to train
the training set. The trained model is used to make
predictions on the test data, and is also applied on the
training data for cross validation. The model with the
highest accuracy is used to make the final prediction.
